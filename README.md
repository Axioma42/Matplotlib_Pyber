## Pyber Ride Sharing

### Analysis

+   There is a clear relation between Average Fare and Number of Rides. This may indicate an overservice problem in urban areas. It can be a normal pattern nonetheless, given the fact the urban rides are shorter than suburban and urban respectively.

+   As the Plots show, there is a considerable fare increase in rural areas. However, there're very few drivers in those areas. Consequently, the total revenue is as low as the number of rides. If there is a tendency that suggests a lift in Pyber services in rural areas, increasing the investment in those areas should be optimal. Not only to grow Pyber's presence but also because it is a safe inversion. Given the fact that the data suggests a high demand, due to the ratio between drivers and the number of rides.

+   Also, it is worth mentioning that Suburban City Types, the Number of Drivers varies significantly. Nevertheless, this City Type is the most homogeneous in terms of Average Fare. Therefore, this could suggest a steady demand for service. Given this stability, becoming aware of the ratio between the total population of those cities and the number of drivers should be helpful to decide, whether an investment in the suburban cities with the lowest ratio drivers per capita is worth it or no.
